# ES6 For Everyone (Wes Bos)

Repo for me to work through Wes Bos' course: [ES6 for Everyone](https://es6.io/).

### Module 1: New Variables
**What are the variable changes introduced in ES6?**
* We always had `var` as a way to define variables.
  * we can update a `var` or redefine it.
* Scope: (*see `var-refresher.html` file for examples*)
  * `var` variables are **function-scoped**.
    * the variable is only accessible within the function (if that's where they're defined), or globally (if not defined in a function).
  * `const` and `let` variables are **block-scoped**.
    * the variable is only accessible within the block { } in which it is defined.
