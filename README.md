# ES6 For Everyone (Wes Bos)

Repo for me to work through Wes Bos' course: [ES6 for Everyone](https://es6.io/).

### Module 1: New Variables
**What are the variable changes introduced in ES6?**
* We always had `var` as a way to define variables.
  * we can update a `var` or redefine it.
* Scoping: `var` variables are function-scoped. Only accessible within the function (if that's where they're defined), or globally (if defined not in a function)
