    //=================================
    // RE-ASSIGNING A VAR VARIABLE
    //=================================
    
    var width = 100; // width initially set to 100
    console.log("Initial assignment: ", width);

    width = 200 // width re-assigned to 200
    console.log("Redefined: ", width);

    //======================
    // SCOPE DIFFERENCES
    //======================

    // var variables are function-scoped
    function setScope() {
      var scope = 300; // defined inside a function
      console.log("Logged from within function: ", scope);
    }
    
    setScope(); // the scope variable is a local variable to the setScope function. The console.log included within the function can access the scope variable.
    // console.log("Attempted log from outside function: ", scope); // this console.log is outside the setScope function, so it doesn't have access to the scope variable. 

    // Scoping Differences
    var threePointMakes = 102;
    if(threePointMakes > 50) {
      var points = threePointMakes * 3; // points VAR variable is not defined in a function, so it is now globally scoped
      console.log(`Player X scored ${points} points from three-pointers!!`);  
    }
    console.log("points variable accessible outside the if statement: ", points); // this code works because the points variable is globally scoped

    var twoPointMakes = 134;
    if (twoPointMakes > 50) {
      let twos = twoPointMakes * 2; // twos LET variable is not defined in a function, but it IS in a block, so it is locally scoped.
      console.log(`Player X scored ${twos} points from two-pointers!!`);
    }
    // console.log("twos variable not accessible outside the if statement: ", twos); // this code doesn't work because the twos variable is block-scoped and therefore isn't accessible outside of the block in which it was defined.

    //======================
    // TEMPORAL DEAD ZONE
    //======================
    var chicagoPizza = "deep-dish";
    console.log(chicagoPizza); // this works fine, chicagoPizza is defined and then logged

    console.log(newYorkPizza);
    var newYorkPizza = "thin-crust"; // this yields undefined (but no error). var variables can be accessed at any point in your code if they have been declared. The value of the variable will not be accessible unless the code that requires the value is written after the variable assignment.

    let cantoneseFood = "char siu"; // this works fine, cantoneseFood is defined and then logged
    console.log(cantoneseFood);

    console.log(sriLankanFood);
    let sriLankanFood = "string-hoppers"; // this yields an error because sriLankanFood variable is called before it has been declared.
